# COMP371 â€” Programming Quiz 2

### Added Features
Some additional features were implemented to go beyond the expectations. The added functionalities include:
- First-person cameras attached to each model translate and rotate fully with its model
- The model-facing spotlight (spotlight1) has a random rotation pattern that can be toggled on/off
- All lights can be toggled on/off
- A hand model added as part of the arm model for more realistic and dynamic movement
- Controlling the model position along the Z-axis for forward and backward displacement
- Controlling the model rotation along both the X-axis for pitch adjustment and the Z-axis for roll adjustment
- Controlling the world rotation along the Z-axis for roll adjustment
- The ability to apply all rotational controls to the lower arm
- The ability to apply all rotational controls to the hand
- Reset the model position and rotation to default
